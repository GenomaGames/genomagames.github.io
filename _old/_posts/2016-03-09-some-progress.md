We have made some progress in the game and we have also defined it's name!

The name is:

*... drum roll...*

# The Seeker

We hope you like it. We think it fits the theme of the game, and it does even have a song written by The Who!

Some of the changes:

- Better blood sprites and animations
- Grenades, explosions and throwing animations
- Running
- Background sprites (walls, doors, furniture, etc.)
- Pickable items (guns, ammo, first aid kit)

... and much more.

We'll keep you posted!
