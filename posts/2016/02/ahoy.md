# Ahoy!

This is the beginning of a ~~bumpy~~ awesome road.

We're starting as an independent video game studio and we are already working on our first game!
We still don't have a name for it (maybe **you can help us with that**), but all we know is that it's going to be _superb_.

## Who are we?

We are two developers and co-workers in Madrid, Spain trying to shift our futures to the world of indie game development. We know it's not easy but «no pain, no gain», right?

## The studio

By now, **Zombie Unicorn Studio** exists only virtually since we don't have a physical studio, but we hope that's an issue to be solved shortly.

If you want to contact us, you can do so via email: **info@zombieunicorn.studio**

## What will you play?

You are a soldier that survived a zombie apocalypse, and your mission will be to move through some abandoned buildings in the city to rescue other survivors.

You will have to find them and safely lead them to an exit, from which you will be picked up and taken to a safe zone.

## What will we do?

We will be showing up some updates about our game, including ideas, animations, problems we find, and all kind of related content.

We encourage you to give us all the feedback you can. Let us know what would make a game that you'd love to play so we can make it for you!

Stay tuned.
