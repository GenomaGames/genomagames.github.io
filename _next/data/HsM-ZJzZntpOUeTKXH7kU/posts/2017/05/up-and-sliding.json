A con is that the speed of development will be slow and probably sometimes the changes will not be so big but let's have patience on this. This is because I'm <strong>developing the game in my free time</strong> so sometimes I'll not being able to spend all the time I want on it [picture my sad face in your mind].</p>\n<p>Ball out!
