These settings are optimized for 2D and 3D Projects across the full range of platforms that Unity supports.\n\n> **2D Template** Configures Project settings for 2D apps, including Texture (Image) Import, Sprite Packer, Scene View, Lighting, and Orthographic Camera packages\n\nChoose the **2D** Project Template. You will need to provide a **Project Name** (This value will also be used as the directory name containing the project) and a **Location** to your file system to where the project will be created. In this example we are setting this values to **Genoma Invaders** and **`C:\\Users\\alber\\develop\\games`**, next you just need to press the **CREATE** button.\n\n![01-UnityHub_2.3.2_New_Project_Panel_with_2D_selected](/assets/2020-07-16-how-to-create-a-unity-2d-project/01-UnityHub_2.3.2_New_Project_Panel_with_2D_selected.png)\n\nThis will create a new directory, in this example **`C:\\Users\\alber\\develop\\games\\Genoma Invaders`**, containing all the project files.\n\n```bash\nGenoma Invaders\n├── Assets\n│   └── Scenes\n│       └── SampleScene.unity\n├── Library\n├── Logs\n├── Packages\n├── ProjectSettings\n└── UserSettings\n```\n\n<small>\n\n_**Note:** Some files and folders have been omitted from the file tree to favor readability._\n\n</small>\n\nUnityHub will open the project with **Unity**:\n\n![02-Unity_2020.1.0b13_(Beta)_blank_2D_project](</assets/2020-07-16-how-to-create-a-unity-2d-project/02-Unity_2020.1.0b13_(Beta)_blank_2D_project.png>)\n\nThat will be all, you are ready to start working in your **New Unity 2D Project**.\n\nCheckout [Unity 2020.1 Manual \"Starting Unity\" Chapter](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/Manual/GettingStarted.html) for more info.\n\nHappy Game Dev! :space_invader:\n","coverImage":{"alt":"Unity Asset Store Sunny Land by Ansimuz","src":"/assets/2020-07-16-how-to-create-a-unity-2d-project/cover_image.jpg"},"date":1594857600000,"draft":false,"summary":"In this article you will learn how to install create a Unity 2D PRoject using UnityHub 2.3.2 in order to start develop...","slug":"2020/07/how-to-create-a-unity-2d-project","title":"How To Create a Unity 2D Project"}},"__N_SSG":true}
