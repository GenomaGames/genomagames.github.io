This game was made for Android, and since I'm using Unity Hub 3.0.0-beta.2 (I'm only using it because it has a black theme), I had to install the required modules for \"Android Build Support\" to be able to compile the game and see if it worked with the new Unity version. It turns out that the installation of that modules is a bit buggy.\n\nIf you are trying to do the same (or close enough) and you are receiving the following message:\n\n```\nFailed to delete old Unity Android Support Installation files. Maybe Unity or some of its tools are still running?\n```\n\nFollow the next steps.\n\n1. Quit all Unity instances\n1. Quit Unity Hub (Ensure it is not still running on the system tray)\n1. Remove the next folder `Unity/Hub/Editor/2020.3.16f1/Editor/Data/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer` in your Unity Hub's installation files\n1. Edit `Unity/Hub/Editor/2020.3.16f1/modules.json` (you'll need admin privileges)(you can [format the json file here](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/)) and update all related \"android\" items to has its property `\"selected\"` to `false`\n1. Copy `Unity/Hub/Editor/2020.3.16f1/modules.json` to `Unity/Hub/Editor/2020.3.16f1/modules.json.bk` (This is your backup)\n1. Edit the file `Unity/Hub/Editor/2020.3.16f1/modules.json` and replace all the \"android\" related file paths using the following rule:\n   - Rename `AndroidPlayer` to `AndroidPlayerTmp` and the folder next to `AndroidPlayer` (SDK, NDK, OpenJDK) to be the item's `\"id\"` value\n   - Example with item with `\"id\"` `\"android-ndk\"`:\n     - `\"{UNITY_PATH}/Editor/Data/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/NDK\"` -> `\"{UNITY_PATH}/Editor/Data/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayerTmp/android-ndk\"`\n     - `\"renameFrom\": \"{UNITY_PATH}/Editor/Data/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/NDK/android-ndk-r19\"` -> `\"renameFrom\": \"{UNITY_PATH}/Editor/Data/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayerTmp/android-ndk/android-ndk-r19\"`\n1. Start Unity Hub and install all \"Android Build Support\" related items\n1. Once it is finished, you should found a `{UNITY_PATH}/Editor/Data/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayerTmp` folder with all the folders with the \"id\" names. If not, you can download the content from the property \"downloadUrl\" of the item (I had to do this with \"android-sdk-platform-tools\")\n1. Copy each item folder content back to its \"AndroidPlayer\" original destination (You have this info in your `modules.json.bk` file)\n1. Edit `Unity/Hub/Editor/2020.3.16f1/modules.json` android items file paths to their original value (You have this info in your `modules.json.bk` file)\n1. Unity should be able to compile your project for Android by now\n\nHappy Game Dev! :space_invader:\n","coverImage":{"src":"/posts/assets/2020-07-02-how-to-install-unity-2020/unity_2020_background.jpg","alt":"Unity 2020 Background"},"date":1629676800000,"draft":false,"summary":"Install Android Build Support on Unity 2020.3.16f1 using Unity Hub 3.0.0-beta.2","slug":"2021/08/how-to-install-android-build-support-with-unity-hub-3-beta-2","title":"How to install Android build support with Unity Hub 3-beta"},{"content":"\n# How to Update a Project's Unity Version\n\nLearn how to upgrade your project's Unity Version.

Also, there has been several improves to the player mechanics and in the environment including a new location.\n\n#### Enemies\n\nThe game now has some hostile NPCs, **bats and boars** , each one with a different logic, movements and attacks.\n\nThe enemies include a **state system** that could be used in the future for more types of NPCs ( **N** on **P** layable **C** haracters). This system manages the state of the NPCs in the game. A **state** is like when an enemy has detected the player, it passes from **neutral state** to **hostile state** and starts attacking the player.\n\nThe player now will encounter **boars** on some locations that will charge against if they see him.\n\n![Boar Enemy](https://i.imgur.com/gNdcpHy.gif)\n\nNow the caves are inhabited by bats, they will be sleeping hanging in the ceiling until the player gets closer, then they will chase the player until losing him.\n\n![Bat Enemy](https://i.imgur.com/sSccgWz.gif)\n\n![Enemies](https://media.giphy.com/media/4GY3obDxCho9HlJSRY/giphy.gif)\n\n#### Player Moves Improvements\n\nThe player mechanics have been improved for a more pleasant the gameplay and to make some things feel more natural according to the game.\n\nNow the player can look up and down (without moving) to see what is above or under him.\n\n![Player Looking Up and Down](https://media.giphy.com/media/4QEQxY4U8eiI37TtJG/giphy.gif)\n\nControls while jumping has changed, when the player is in the air can move and change his direction, slower than if he where in the ground, and the jump height can be altered depending on how long the jump button is pressed. This could change in the future but at this moment it feels pretty good.\n\n![Player Jumping](https://media.giphy.com/media/OPwxxuiO1icr69DJsR/giphy.gif)\n\nIf the player attacks while moving he will stop moving to land the attack.\n\n![Player Moving and Attacking](https://media.giphy.com/media/1itJg84KaGIU3ANiGr/giphy.gif)\n\nIf the player takes damage he will be thrown away at the incoming attack direction.\n\n![Player Taking Damage](https://media.giphy.com/media/9DcC8MtQxbg9LNEvrc/giphy.gif)\n\n#### Improves in Camera System\n\nNow the camera switch side when the player alters his looking direction.\n\n![Player Changing Camera Direction](https://media.giphy.com/media/p43W9QFKQxsPyyIUeh/giphy.gif)\n\n#### New Game Country Location\n\nNow there is a new set of sprites to create country-ish locations!\n\n![Country Location](https://media.giphy.com/media/ozjF8ZMxh17T5JMy2n/giphy.gif)\n\n### What's Next?\n\n- First history based levels\n- Public **Alpha Game Release**\n- More enemies\n- Attack while jumping\n- Polishing\n\n### Stay Tuned\n\nYou can follow the project progress on [@GenomaGames](https://twitter.com/GenomaGames)\n","coverImage":null,"date":1537660800000,"draft":false,"summary":"This is the third devlog of the project P2D (Name to be defined).

Here is some old stuff I did time ago before sticking to something simpler:\n\n![Old Concept Art](/posts/assets/ghost-posts-images/2018/04/Concept.png)\n\nI get to implement those tiles and the main character and some animations but the thing is that I last too much in finishing this assets and the feeling were of doing slow progress. So I decided to dump all the progress I did and start clean with a simpler idea and very basic mechanics.\n\n### Clean Start\n\nI did a character concept with a small pixel ratio and a few animations, which let me spend less but enough time doing art:\n\n![Player First Animations](https://i.imgur.com/sDojV70.gif)\n\nAnd then I create a small level concept animated by hand:\n\n![First Game Concept Animation](https://i.imgur.com/0U2gb8F.gif)\n\nWith this assets I could make a very very simple game, but was enough for me to keep with the project without losing enthusiasm. What I also did was spamming my friends and teammates with my progress in the game, this helped me a lot since any bit of attention were a pretty good point to continue with the project.\n\nAlso at the same time Unity released the [2D Game Kit](https://unity3d.com/es/learn/tutorials/s/2d-game-kit) to help people without code knowledge start developing 2D games. Guess what? I have a small experience with Unity3D and C# programming but I took advantage of this and used some of their scripts to have some things working without losing too much time thinking, like the respawn logic or the scene controller.\n\n### Core Mechanics\n\nI defined in a flowchart the **core mechanics** of the game (movement, jump, camera follow, health, damage and dead) with small descriptions of what I want this mechanics to be like. I also spend some time defining some game history like how the world is, what is going on or some superadvanced mechanics, just for fun and to see a bit of the big picture and not get bored with simpler stuff.\n\n### Results\n\nWith my core mechanics defined I started developing the game with some of the core mechanics. I've end up having a small prototype where you can move around with this character (name to be defined) jumping over a bunch of platforms made from the same tileset, testing how the game feels and gathering as much feedback as I can from the people that played it.\n\nOnce I had the health, damage and dead mechanics I implemented **fall damage**. If you fall from a great height you'll die:\n\n![Implemented Fall Damage](https://i.imgur.com/u6K4jyV.gif)\n\nThen I implemented level transitions to load new areas:\n\n![Zone Swapping](https://i.imgur.com/cpdLGT6.gif)\n\nAnd finally a small **Start Menu** to have something that feels more like a game:\n\n![Start Menu](https://i.imgur.com/gXJXsZt.png)\n\n### Now what?\n\nNow I iterate over and over and over until having a game. Next thing to make will probably be:\n\n- Attack\n- Health Points\n- Destructibles\n- Collectables\n- A new tileset\n\n### Stay Tuned\n\nYou can follow the project progress on:\n\n- [Twitter @GenomaGames](https://twitter.com/GenomaGames)\n- [Imgur](https://genomagames.imgur.com/)\n- [Tumblr](https://genomagames.tumblr.com)\n- [Itch.io](https://genomagames.itch.io/project-p2d)\n- [Game Jolt](https://genomagames.gamejolt.io/project-p2d)\n","coverImage":null,"date":1524096000000,"draft":false,"summary":"This is the first devlog for the new project codenamed P2D I'm working on.
