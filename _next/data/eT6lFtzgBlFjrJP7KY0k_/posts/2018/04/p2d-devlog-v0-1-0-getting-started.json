It's still a prototype more than a game and I'm yet trying to find the correct mechanics for the gameplay experience I'm looking for.\n\n### TL;DR\n\nI removed all my gamedev progress and started from zero.\n\n**New mechanics!**\n\n- **Movement**: The player can move around with his legs.\n- **Jumping**: The player jump around with his legs.\n- **Camera Follow**: There will be some magic entity that will follow you very smoothly filming whatever you're doing.\n- **Health**: The player have health, is a living thing\n- **Damage**: The player can be damaged losing health\n- **Dead**: The player can die respawning where he started the level\n\n**New gameplay experiences!**\n\n- **Move and jump** around the world with the smoothest **camera follow** ever.\n- Currently the only thing that could **kill you** is **fall damage**.\n\nScroll down to see some screenshots and GIFs!\n\n### Wiping the Dust\n\nThis project has some past. Here is some old stuff I did time ago before sticking to something simpler:\n\n![Old Concept Art](/assets/ghost-posts-images/2018/04/Concept.png)\n\nI get to implement those tiles and the main character and some animations but the thing is that I last too much in finishing this assets and the feeling were of doing slow progress. So I decided to dump all the progress I did and start clean with a simpler idea and very basic mechanics.\n\n### Clean Start\n\nI did a character concept with a small pixel ratio and a few animations, which let me spend less but enough time doing art:\n\n![Player First Animations](https://i.imgur.com/sDojV70.gif)\n\nAnd then I create a small level concept animated by hand:\n\n![First Game Concept Animation](https://i.imgur.com/0U2gb8F.gif)\n\nWith this assets I could make a very very simple game, but was enough for me to keep with the project without losing enthusiasm. What I also did was spamming my friends and teammates with my progress in the game, this helped me a lot since any bit of attention were a pretty good point to continue with the project.\n\nAlso at the same time Unity released the [2D Game Kit](https://unity3d.com/es/learn/tutorials/s/2d-game-kit) to help people without code knowledge start developing 2D games. Guess what? I have a small experience with Unity3D and C# programming but I took advantage of this and used some of their scripts to have some things working without losing too much time thinking, like the respawn logic or the scene controller.\n\n### Core Mechanics\n\nI defined in a flowchart the **core mechanics** of the game (movement, jump, camera follow, health, damage and dead) with small descriptions of what I want this mechanics to be like. I also spend some time defining some game history like how the world is, what is going on or some superadvanced mechanics, just for fun and to see a bit of the big picture and not get bored with simpler stuff.\n\n### Results\n\nWith my core mechanics defined I started developing the game with some of the core mechanics. I've end up having a small prototype where you can move around with this character (name to be defined) jumping over a bunch of platforms made from the same tileset, testing how the game feels and gathering as much feedback as I can from the people that played it.\n\nOnce I had the health, damage and dead mechanics I implemented **fall damage**. If you fall from a great height you'll die:\n\n![Implemented Fall Damage](https://i.imgur.com/u6K4jyV.gif)\n\nThen I implemented level transitions to load new areas:\n\n![Zone Swapping](https://i.imgur.com/cpdLGT6.gif)\n\nAnd finally a small **Start Menu** to have something that feels more like a game:\n\n![Start Menu](https://i.imgur.com/gXJXsZt.png)\n\n### Now what?\n\nNow I iterate over and over and over until having a game. Next thing to make will probably be:\n\n- Attack\n- Health Points\n- Destructibles\n- Collectables\n- A new tileset\n\n### Stay Tuned\n\nYou can follow the project progress on:\n\n- [Twitter @GenomaGames](https://twitter.com/GenomaGames)\n- [Imgur](https://genomagames.imgur.com/)\n- [Tumblr](https://genomagames.tumblr.com)\n- [Itch.io](https://genomagames.itch.io/project-p2d)\n- [Game Jolt](https://genomagames.gamejolt.io/project-p2d)\n","coverImage":null,"date":1524096000000,"draft":false,"excerpt":"This is the first devlog for the new project codenamed P2D I'm working on.
