We already know, but it's a surprise :)\n\nTo keep things clear, we contacted the guys at Asthree and asked them if they where ok with this. They where very cool about it and let us keep the images in this site while we define our own character.\n\nMaybe you continue to see more animations or images in which this character appears, but he will be replaced shortly.\n\nTo thank the guys at Asthree, go and pre-order Paradise Lost at their [store](http://asthreeworks.com/store/). You won't regret.\n\nBye!\n","coverImage":null,"date":1457538658000,"draft":false,"summary":"The main character we're using right now is not ours.
