A <strong>state</strong> is like when an enemy has detected the player, it passes from <strong>neutral state</strong> to <strong>hostile state</strong> and starts attacking the player.</p>\n<p>The player now will encounter <strong>boars</strong> on some locations that will charge against if they see him.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gNdcpHy.gif\" alt=\"Boar Enemy\">\n<p>Now the caves are inhabited by bats, they will be sleeping hanging in the ceiling until the player gets closer, then they will chase the player until losing him.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sSccgWz.gif\" alt=\"Bat Enemy\">\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/4GY3obDxCho9HlJSRY/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Enemies\">\n<h4 id=\"player-moves-improvements\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#player-moves-improvements\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Player Moves Improvements</h4>\n<p>The player mechanics have been improved for a more pleasant the gameplay and to make some things feel more natural according to the game.</p>\n<p>Now the player can look up and down (without moving) to see what is above or under him.</p>\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/4QEQxY4U8eiI37TtJG/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Player Looking Up and Down\">\n<p>Controls while jumping has changed, when the player is in the air can move and change his direction, slower than if he where in the ground, and the jump height can be altered depending on how long the jump button is pressed.
