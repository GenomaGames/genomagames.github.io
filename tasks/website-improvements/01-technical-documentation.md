# Technical Documentation for LLM Agents

## Current State

The project currently has limited documentation about its structure, architecture, and design decisions. While the code is well-organized following domain-driven design principles, there's no comprehensive documentation that explains the overall architecture, data flow, and component relationships.

## Recommendations

### 1. Project Architecture Overview

Create a comprehensive document that explains:

- The high-level architecture of the application
- The key design patterns and principles used
- The rationale behind architectural decisions
- System boundaries and integration points

### 2. Domain Model Documentation

Document the core domain model:

- Key entities and their relationships
- Value objects and aggregates
- Domain services and their responsibilities
- Repository implementations and data access patterns

### 3. Directory Structure Guide

Create a guide explaining the purpose of each directory and file:

```
/src
  /app - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
  /components - Reusable UI components
  /Posts - Domain module for blog posts
    /application - Use cases and application services
    /domain - Domain models and interfaces
    /infrastructure - Implementation details
  /Games - Domain module for games
  /i18n - Internationalization configuration
  /styles - Global styles and CSS modules
/data - Data files for posts, games, etc.
/public - Static assets
```

### 4. Data Flow Documentation

Document how data flows through the application:

- Request lifecycle from client to server
- Data fetching patterns
- State management approach
- Rendering strategy (SSG, SSR, CSR)

### 5. Component Documentation

Add inline documentation for key components:

- Purpose and responsibilities
- Props and their types
- Internal state management
- Side effects and lifecycle

### 6. Development Workflow Guide

Create a guide for the development workflow:

- Local development setup
- Build and deployment process
- Testing strategy
- Code quality tools and standards

### 7. Internationalization Documentation

Document the internationalization approach:

- Supported languages and locales
- Translation workflow
- URL structure for localized routes
- Content localization strategy

### 8. Technical Glossary

Create a glossary of project-specific terms:

- Domain-specific terminology
- Architectural concepts
- Framework-specific terms
- Abbreviations and acronyms

## Benefits for LLM Agents

This documentation will significantly improve LLM agents' ability to:

1. **Understand Context**: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the project's architecture and design principles
2. **Navigate the Codebase**: Quickly locate relevant files and understand their purpose
3. **Make Informed Recommendations**: Suggest improvements that align with the existing architecture
4. **Generate Accurate Code**: Produce code that follows the project's patterns and conventions
5. **Explain Rationale**: Provide clear explanations for suggested changes based on documented principles
