Hey guys!

This time is my turn to write an entry due that [@matto](/author/matto/), our beloved developer is outside of the country (and not for _immigration issues_).

Well this entry is going to be short but awesome because I'm going to show you our brand new **studio logo**!!!

And here it is!

Unpredictable uh? yeah... I know...

Actually this entry is because I feel lonely... so lonely.

Please **comment**! Say what do you think about our logo, what you think would be nice to do with it or just tell us your life, cheers!
